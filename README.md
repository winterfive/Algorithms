# Algorithms

I wrote several algorithms without using any built in methods.  This file includes:

Generate an Array of random ints  
Print array inside a frame of pipes  
Return element found at index  
Checks array for value (boolean)  
Delete element and move all following elements  
Insert new element at end of Array  
Linear Search

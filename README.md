# Algorithms

I wrote several algorithms without using any built in methods.  
  
ArrayStructures.java includes:
Generate an Array of random ints  
Print array horizontally inside a frame of pipes  
Return element found at index  
Checks array for value (boolean)  
Delete element and move all following elements  
Insert new element at end of Array  
Linear Search  
Bubble Sort (ascending)  
Bubble Sort (descending)  
Swap values at two indexes  
Binary Search  
Selection Sort  
Insertion Sort

QuickSort.java displays quick sort and partitioning code
